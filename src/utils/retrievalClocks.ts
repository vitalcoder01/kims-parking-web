// minutes"), not a vehicle ETA. The system cannot promise when a car will
// arrive — that depends on valet dispatch and driver travel — so nothing
// derived from it may ever be shown to the doctor as an arrival estimate.
//
// It exists for exactly three things, all valet-side: the inbox badge, inbox
// ordering, and prioritisation.
//
// The only honest clock is the trip itself, which starts when the driver
// actually sets off (startedAt) and is therefore real elapsed time.

// Quick picks. Anything else is chosen on the clock (see CUSTOM_DEPARTURE),
// which is why this list is short rather than trying to cover every case.
