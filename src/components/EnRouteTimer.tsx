 * "on the way 4:12" — the one place in the valet's screen that genuinely
 * needs a per-second clock.
 *
 * It owns that clock itself, which is the entire point. The screen used to
 * hold a single `now` ticking every second so this label could count, and
 * every other time-derived value on the screen — "5 min ago", "45 MIN",
 * the urgency sort — was dragged along with it. Those are all
 * minute-granularity, so 59 of every 60 renders of a very large screen
 * produced byte-identical output.
 *
 * Isolating the second-hand here means the screen can tick slowly and only
 * this small subtree re-renders each second.
