/*
 * Feeds the creature.
 *
 * ── Why this ticks, and why slowly ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Most rules are elapsed-time rules ("no driver for over 5 min"), so they
 * become true while nothing else changes and no re-render would otherwise
 * happen. Something has to re-evaluate them on a clock.
 *
 * 15s, not 1s. Every threshold in the engine is minutes; a per-second tick
 * would re-run the rules sixty times to change an answer once, which is the
 * exact waste this session removed from the valet and doctor screens. The
 * cost of being at most fifteen seconds late to say "nobody has picked this
 * up for five minutes" is nothing.
 *
 * The tick stops when the app is backgrounded. A co-pilot recomputing
 * staffing ratios in a pocket helps nobody and costs battery.
 *
 * Connection state is read from the socket here rather than lifted into
 * AppStateContext, deliberately: adding a value there would re-render every
 * consumer in the app on every connect/disconnect, and this session was
 * largely spent removing exactly that kind of churn. Polling it on a tick we
 * are already paying for is free.
 *
 * Web port of the mobile hook — identical rules and thresholds, with
 * document visibility standing in for RN's AppState.
